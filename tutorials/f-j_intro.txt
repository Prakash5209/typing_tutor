Introduction to the F and J Keys: The Starting Point of Typing Mastery

When learning to type, the F and J keys are your home base. These two keys are where your index fingers naturally rest and play a crucial role in developing proper hand positioning and muscle memory.

You’ll notice that both the F and J keys have a small raised bump or ridge — this tactile marker helps you find your position on the keyboard without looking. Your left index finger should rest on the F key, and your right index finger on the J key. From here, the rest of your fingers naturally fall into place over the home row (A–S–D–F for the left hand and J–K–L–; for the right hand).

By starting with the F and J keys:

You build a strong foundation for touch typing.

You reduce reliance on looking at the keyboard.

You develop accuracy and speed over time.

Mastering these two keys may seem simple, but they are the gateway to typing with confidence and precision. Return to them often, and let them guide your hands as you progress in your typing journey.
