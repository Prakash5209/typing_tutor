Introduction to the S and L Keys: Strengthening Control and Precision
As you continue to build your typing foundation, the S and L keys are the next essential steps. These keys are where your ring fingers naturally rest on the home row — the S key for your left hand, and the L key for your right hand.

While the ring fingers are often less dominant than the index or middle fingers, training them is crucial for achieving full control and balance across the keyboard.

Why S and L Matter:
They strengthen finger coordination, helping you maintain proper hand placement without looking down.

They improve typing balance, ensuring your weaker fingers stay active and responsive.

They appear in many common words, so mastering them boosts typing fluency and confidence.

By focusing on the S and L keys, you're not only training underused fingers but also refining your accuracy and discipline as a typist. Give these keys the attention they deserve — they help turn basic finger movements into a seamless typing flow.
