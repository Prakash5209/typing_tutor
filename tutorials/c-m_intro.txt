Introduction to the C and M Keys: Navigating the Bottom Row
The C and M keys are part of the bottom row of the keyboard. C is typed with your left middle finger, and M with your right middle finger. These keys help develop control and accuracy in your fingers as you move beyond the home row.

Why C and M Matter:
They train your middle fingers to reach downward with precision.

Both letters are common in everyday words, making them essential for typing fluency.

Practicing these keys improves your ability to transition smoothly across the keyboard.

Mastering the C and M keys helps you build confidence in your bottom-row typing and enhances overall speed and accuracy.
