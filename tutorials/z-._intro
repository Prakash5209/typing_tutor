Introduction to the Z and Period Keys: Completing Your Bottom Row Mastery
The Z and . (period) keys are the outermost keys on the bottom row. Z is typed with your left pinky finger, and period with your right pinky finger. These keys help strengthen your pinkies and complete your control over the entire keyboard.

Why Z and Period Matter:
They train your pinky fingers to reach and press keys with accuracy and confidence.

Both keys are important for typing common words and punctuation marks.

Practicing these keys builds overall hand flexibility and balance, critical for fast, error-free typing.

Mastering Z and the period key ensures you can navigate the full keyboard with ease and precision.
