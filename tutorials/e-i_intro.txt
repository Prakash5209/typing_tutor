Introduction to the E and I Keys: Reaching with Precision
The E and I keys are important characters on the top row of the keyboard. E is typed with your left middle finger, and I with your right middle finger. These keys build on the vertical reach you developed with the home row, helping you stretch upward with control.

Why E and I Matter:
E is the most frequently used letter in the English language â€” mastering it boosts typing fluency significantly.

I appears often in words and is crucial for smooth right-hand top-row coordination.

Practicing these keys strengthens your middle fingers, helping them become as responsive as your index fingers.

Typing E and I with accuracy teaches your fingers to reach up confidently and return smoothly, reinforcing speed, accuracy, and hand balance.
