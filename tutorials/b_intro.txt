Introduction to the B Key and Neighboring Letters: Bridging the Bottom and Home Rows
The B key sits at the intersection of the bottom row and home row, typed with your left index finger. It plays a unique role in connecting your finger movements between rows, helping you develop fluid transitions.

Why B Matters:
It strengthens your left index finger’s ability to move vertically and laterally.

The B key appears frequently in English words, making it essential for speed and accuracy.

It helps bridge the home row (G, H) and bottom row (V, N), encouraging smooth hand coordination.
