Introduction to the W and O Keys: Stretching with Control
The W and O keys sit on the top row, just beyond your natural resting position. W is typed with your left ring finger, and O with your right ring finger. These keys help train your fingers to reach farther while maintaining accuracy.

Why W and O Matter:
They develop strength and flexibility in your ring fingers, which are often less agile.

They teach proper reach-and-return technique, essential for smooth touch typing.

Both letters are commonly used, especially in short words and pronouns like “we,” “was,” “who,” “on,” and “of.”

By practicing W and O, you build confidence in your ability to cover the full keyboard without looking — a vital skill for fast and accurate typing.
