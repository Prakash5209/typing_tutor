Introduction to the D and K Keys: Building Balance in Typing
After becoming comfortable with the F and J keys, the next important keys to focus on are D and K. These keys are where your middle fingers rest on the home row and are essential for maintaining correct hand positioning.

Your left middle finger should rest on the D key, and your right middle finger on the K key. Along with F and J, these keys help form the core structure of touch typing — a balanced and ergonomic hand position that leads to better accuracy and speed.

Why D and K matter:

They train your middle fingers, which often get less attention but are vital for reaching nearby keys.

They help build rhythm and balance between both hands.

They prepare you to type words more fluidly, as D and K appear frequently in English.

Focusing on D and K strengthens your connection to the home row and ensures that both hands are actively and equally involved in the typing process. Practice them deliberately — they are small keys that make a big difference in your typing journey.
