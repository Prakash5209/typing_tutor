Introduction to the V and N Keys: Strengthening the Bottom Row
The V and N keys are important parts of the bottom row on your keyboard. V is pressed by your left index finger, and N by your right index finger. These keys help you expand your typing skills beyond the home row, building control and accuracy on the lower part of the keyboard.

Why V and N Matter:
They develop your index fingers’ ability to move down confidently and precisely.

Both letters are commonly used in English words, contributing to your typing fluency.

Practicing V and N supports smooth hand movement across different rows, improving overall typing speed.

Focusing on V and N strengthens your fingers’ coordination and balance, key to becoming a proficient typist.
