Introduction to the Q and P Keys: Mastering the Keyboard’s Edges
The Q and P keys are the outermost keys on the top row of your keyboard. Q is typed with your left pinky, and P with your right pinky. These keys help train your pinky fingers to stretch and move confidently, which is crucial for effective touch typing.

Why Q and P Matter:
They strengthen your pinky fingers, which are typically the weakest and least used.

They teach you to reach the far edges of the keyboard without losing your hand’s home position.

Though less frequent than some other letters, mastering Q and P is important for typing words, shortcuts, and punctuation efficiently.

Practicing Q and P builds finger strength, improves accuracy, and rounds out your ability to use the keyboard confidently from edge to edge.
