Introduction to the G and H Keys: The Center Pillars of the Keyboard
At the heart of the home row lie the G and H keys — the quiet pillars that support balance and symmetry in touch typing. These keys sit between your index fingers: G is typed with your left index finger, and H with your right index finger.

Though they don’t serve as resting points like F and J, the G and H keys are frequently used and play an important role in developing control and coordination.

Why G and H Matter:
They reinforce the range and flexibility of your index fingers, the most active fingers in typing.

They support natural hand movement, allowing your fingers to reach other keys with ease.

Both keys appear often in English words, contributing to typing speed and rhythm.

Practicing G and H ensures your index fingers are not just resting well, but also moving with purpose and precision. These central keys help you transition smoothly across the keyboard, making them essential for fluid and efficient typing.
