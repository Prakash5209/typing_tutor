Introduction to the T and Y Keys: Strengthening Your Reach
The T and Y keys are located on the top row, just to the left and right of the center. T is typed with your left index finger, and Y with your right index finger.

These keys are important for developing your fingers’ reach and dexterity, helping you move smoothly across the keyboard while maintaining speed and accuracy.

Why T and Y Matter:
They help improve your index fingers’ flexibility and control beyond the home row.

Both letters are frequently used in English, appearing in many common words.

Practicing these keys reinforces your ability to transition fluidly between keys and rows.

Mastering the T and Y keys strengthens your overall typing rhythm and precision, making your typing faster and more comfortable.
