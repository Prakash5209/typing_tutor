Introduction to the R and U Keys: Expanding Reach and Speed
Moving up from the home row, the R and U keys introduce the next layer of finger movement. These keys are located on the top row — with R typed using your left index finger, and U typed with your right index finger.

Practicing R and U helps you build vertical movement from the home row and teaches your fingers to return to their base position after reaching.

Why R and U Matter:
They train your index fingers to move upward efficiently without losing alignment.

They are common letters in English, often appearing in everyday words.

They improve your ability to reach and return, a critical part of fluid touch typing.

By practicing R and U regularly, you improve your typing rhythm, control, and speed — unlocking greater confidence across the keyboard.
