# Keystroke Improver GUI Application

## Overview

The **Keystroke Improver** is a Python-based desktop application designed to enhance typing speed and accuracy by focusing on frequently mistyped letters. By analyzing user input with the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** machine learning algorithm, the application identifies common typing errors and generates personalized practice words to help users improve their weak areas.

This tool features an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) developed with PyQt5, making it accessible for users of all skill levels. Its adaptive learning approach ensures efficient, targeted typing practice, promoting better muscle memory, accuracy, and speed.

## Features

- Identification of frequently mistyped letters using machine learning (KNN).  
- Personalized practice word suggestions tailored to user errors.  
- User-friendly GUI for easy interaction and practice.  
- Focus on gradual improvement of typing proficiency and accuracy.

## Objectives

- Enhance typing speed and accuracy by reducing errors.  
- Analyze user input patterns to identify typing weaknesses.  
- Provide personalized typing exercises for effective learning.
