# Chapter 2: Background

## 2.1 Problem Statement

In today's digital world, typing proficiency is an essential skill for students, professionals, and anyone who uses computers regularly. Many individuals struggle with typing speed and accuracy, which can significantly impact productivity. Existing typing tutors often lack real-time feedback or have complex interfaces that discourage consistent practice.

## 2.2 Literature Review

Typing tutor applications have evolved significantly since the early text-based programs of the 1980s. Modern typing tutors incorporate gamification elements, real-time feedback, and personalized learning paths. Research indicates that immediate feedback on typing errors leads to faster skill development compared to delayed feedback systems.

Studies by Logan and Crump (2010) demonstrate that typing involves two distinct cognitive processes: an outer loop that generates language and an inner loop that handles the keystroke sequences. Effective typing tutors must address both processes by providing meaningful content and keystroke-level feedback.

## 2.3 Existing Solutions

Several typing tutor applications exist in the market, including:

- Typing.com: Web-based platform with structured lessons
- 10FastFingers: Focuses on speed tests with random words
- Keybr: Uses algorithmic approach to identify weak keys
- TypingClub: Gamified approach with progress tracking

While these solutions offer various features, many lack the combination of simplicity, real-time feedback, and comprehensive practice options that users need for effective skill development.

# Chapter 3: Analysis & Design

## 3.1 Requirements Analysis

### 3.1.1 Functional Requirements

1. User authentication (login, registration, password recovery)
2. Random word generation for typing tests
3. Real-time input validation and feedback
4. Timed typing tests with performance metrics
5. Practice mode with different difficulty levels
6. User account management
7. Performance history and statistics

### 3.1.2 Non-Functional Requirements

1. Responsive and intuitive user interface
2. Real-time performance with minimal lag
3. Cross-platform compatibility
4. Secure user data storage
5. Scalability to accommodate additional features

## 3.2 System Architecture

The application follows an object-oriented architecture with a modular design. It uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, where:

- Model: Data structures and business logic (word generation, input validation)
- View: UI files and screen components
- Controller: Python classes that handle user interactions and screen navigation

The application is built using PyQt5 framework for the GUI components and utilizes multi-threading for timer functionality.

## 3.3 Database Design

The current implementation uses file-based storage for test words. Future versions could implement a relational database to store:

- User accounts and authentication data
- Performance history and statistics
- Custom word lists and practice sets

## 3.4 User Interface Design

The user interface is designed with simplicity and usability in mind. Key screens include:

1. Login Screen: User authentication with options for registration and password recovery
2. Home Screen: Main typing test interface with text display and input field
3. Practice Screen: Specialized practice exercises
4. Account Screen: User profile and performance statistics

The interface uses consistent styling and layout across all screens, with clear navigation between different sections of the application.

# Chapter 4: Implementation & Testing

## 4.1 Development Environment

The application was developed using:

- Python 3.x as the primary programming language
- PyQt5 framework for GUI components
- Qt Designer for UI layout design
- NumPy for data processing

## 4.2 Implementation Details

### 4.2.1 Core Components

1. **Screen Management**: The application uses QStackedWidget to manage multiple screens within a single window, allowing seamless navigation between different interfaces.

2. **Word Generation**: The module1.py file contains functionality to generate random words from a predefined text file, providing varied content for typing tests.

3. **Input Validation**: The LiveInputChecker class provides real-time validation of user input, comparing it against the target text and providing visual feedback.

4. **Timer System**: A multi-threaded timer implementation using QThread and Worker classes ensures accurate timing for typing tests without blocking the UI.

### 4.2.2 User Interface

The UI is implemented using Qt Designer, with XML-based .ui files defining the layout and properties of each screen. These files are loaded dynamically at runtime using PyQt5's uic module.

### 4.2.3 Key Algorithms

1. **Input Checking Algorithm**: Compares user input against target text character by character, providing color-coded feedback (green for correct, red for incorrect).

2. **Word Selection Algorithm**: Randomly selects words from a large corpus, ensuring varied practice material.

## 4.3 Testing

### 4.3.1 Unit Testing

Individual components were tested in isolation to verify correct functionality:

- Word generation module was tested for randomness and proper text cleaning
- Input validation was tested with various input scenarios
- Timer functionality was tested for accuracy and proper thread management

### 4.3.2 Integration Testing

Integration tests were performed to ensure proper interaction between components:

- Screen navigation flow
- Data passing between screens
- Timer integration with input validation

### 4.3.3 User Acceptance Testing

User testing was conducted to gather feedback on:

- Interface usability and intuitiveness
- Real-time feedback effectiveness
- Overall user experience
