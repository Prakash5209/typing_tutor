    Suggest best word matches based on mistyped letters using a file as the dataset and
    write results to an output file. Clears the output file each time it's run.

    Parameters:
    - input_letters (list of str): Mistyped letters by the user.
    - file_path (str): Path to the file containing a list of valid words (one per line).
    - output_file_path (str): Path to the output file where matches will be written.
    - top_k (int): Number of best matches to return. Default is 10.
    - max_word_length (int): Maximum allowed length of words to consider. Default is 8.
